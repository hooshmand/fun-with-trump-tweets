# Make Tweets Great Again

This script will run a search for Tweets that are "make _ great again" snowclones, and retweet them.

You need to `pip install twython`, and you also need to add a `credentials.json` file that looks like

```
{
  "consumer_key" : "...",
  "consumer_secret" : "...",
  "access_token_key" : "...", 
  "access_token_secret" : "..."
}
```

and then just run it.
